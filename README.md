# marble-sort
Marble sorter created using Arduino Uno! 

How it works: <br>
1) Photoresistor is used to determine colour of the marble <br>
2) Stepper motor rotates to open appropriate channel that the marble should roll into and then rotates back to the original position <br>
3) Servo motor rotates to allow marble to roll <br>
4) Servo motor closes to repeat  process for next marble in line <br>
5) Process terminates after 5 marbles are sorted and LED lights up to signal end <br> <br>
